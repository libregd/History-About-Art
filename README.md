Some studying notes about history of art, write down by Chinese.

before I build it,  I want to find a method could support :gh-page deploy + easy way to web pages add + every page could customize.

Gitbook has bought hope into my heart , unfortunately, despite I'm too lazy, I don't want to dropped my thoughts.
